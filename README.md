The weather app
The following application was created for a local weather organization that provides a detailed view of the weather daily and the average temperatures for the week. The application makes use of arrays, loops, and screen navigation. It consists of a splash screen, main screen, and a detailed view screen. The Weather App runs on 96,3% of all android devices.

The weather app is designed to keep track of the weather for the week and determine average temperatures. The application has a splash screen, a main screen, and lastly a detailed view screen. The first page is the splash screen where the user can either press the start button and be directed to the main screen or exit the application. Once the user is on the main screen, they input temperatures and add it to the array. The user can then either clear the data, view the detailed screen or exit the application. The detailed view screen provides the user with a comprehensive overview of the weather and the average temperatures. The user can then either exit the application or return to the main screen.

cThe user interface designed is intuitive and overall easy to navigate. The user interface is designed to be compatible with a variety of screens and devices while providing a seamless user experience. It grabs the attention of the user and is designed using material design principles such as the use of vibrant colours, consistency within the layout and components, and the use of images. The appearance of the UI is sleek. The UI of the splash screen makes use of buttons such as a start button and an exit button. The user interface has a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

The user interface is displayed as it would be displayed on the user’s screen/device. This screenshot shows the layout of the start screen, and displays the image view, both the start and exit button, and lastly the text view. It also displays the use of vibrant colours and the attraction the application poses for users.
The provided screenshots show the source code of the Weather App that is written in the Kotlin coding language. The MainActivity and DetailedView class shows all the functions coded to make the application function such as the use of the setOnClickListener function. The application code also makes use of multiple if statements to ensure that the temperatures change when necessary. All of these functions only work once all the necessary variables have been initialized. The variables are initialized in the code by either using var or val. Lastly, each button is set by using the set on click listener function and then coding the functions.

There were a lot of factors to consider while coding my application. First, the text's size and colour scheme. This is significant since it impacts the application's usability and visibility. The position of the display text view functions is another thing to take into account when coding the application. All the text view functions were positioned with enough space and in a legible font size.

Throughout the development process GitHub was used. GitHub is a coding platform that hosts users for collaborations, version control, and continuous integration. With the use of GitHub developers are enabled to easily share files for code and simultaneously provide input for the development of software. It allows developers or users to track changes to code in a web-based interface and automates testing and deployment of software. GitHub ensures that applications are robust and maintainable.

To make use of the above-mentioned GitHub actions a user must create a repository. The repository is used to store your code and a files revision history. The repository used for my application is named WeatherApp and is a public file. The GitHub folder includes a ReadMe file. A ReadMe file is a description of the code in the repository. To share your code from Android Studios to GitHub regularly commit and push your updated software files. This ensures that every version of the application can be seen and edited. This also allows the user to easily test the application other than on Android Studios. 
For the submission of this application, the code had to be pushed onto a GitHub classroom link. To push the files open and run command prompt (CMD) where I then typed the necessary commands and configuration steps to push my Kotlin code file onto GitHub. Once all the correct commands are typed and necessary steps are followed, refresh the browser and all the necessary files should be pushed and reflect on the GitHub classroom link. In the ReadMe file ensure the link of the YouTube video presentation is added.  The video demonstrates how the application functions and runs on a user’s device/screen. The last step of the submission process is to add the ReadMe link into the write up of the application and submit on both Brightspace and GitHub.

And lastly, using Android Studio for the developing process of this task. The coding language Kotlin, a condensed form of Java, was used with Android Studio to create this application, The Weather App. Android Studio is the official IDE (integrated development environment) for creating Android software/applications. Coding tools including an emulator, gradle build system, code editor, testing tools, and much more are available for use in Android studio. These features make it simple to develop and test applications. With Android Studio, users may create effective, high-quality Android applications.
